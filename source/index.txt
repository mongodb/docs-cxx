The following guide provides information on using the MongoDB C++
Driver.

Community
---------

We are lucky to have a vibrant MongoDB Java community with lots of
varying experience of using the Java driver. Often, the quickest way to
get support for general questions is through the
`mongodb-user google group <http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user>`
or through
`Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb%20c%2b%2b>`_.

Please also refer to our own
`support channels <http://www.mongodb.org/about/support>`_
documentation.
